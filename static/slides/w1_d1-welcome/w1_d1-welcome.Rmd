## Create a GitHub account

.instructions[
Go to [github.com](https://github.com/), and create an account (unless you already have one).

Tips for selecting a username:<sup>✦</sup>

.midi[
- Incorporate your actual name.
- Reuse username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack.
- Pick a username you'll be comfortable revealing to your future boss.
- Shorter is better than longer.
- Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible.
- Make it timeless. Don’t highlight your current university, employer, etc.
- Avoid words laden with special meaning in programming, like `NA`.
]

.instructions[
Once done, place a green sticky on your laptop. If you have questions, place a pink sticky.

## Create your first data visualization

- Once you log on to RStudio Cloud, click on this course's workspace "STA 112FS - Fall 2018".
- Make a copy of the project called UN Votes, and launch it.
- In the Files pane in the bottom right corner, spot the file called `unvotes.Rmd`. Open it, and then click on the "Knit" button.
- Go back to the file and change your name on top (in the `yaml` -- we'll talk about what this means later) and knit again.
- Then change the country names to those you're interested in. Your spelling and capitalization should match how the countries appear in the data, so take a peek at the Appendix to see how the country names are spelled. Knit again. And voila, your first data visualization!

Every election cycle brings its own brand of excitement -- and lots of money. 
Political donations are of particular interest to political scientists and 
other researchers studying politics and voting patterns. They are also of 
interest to citizens who want to stay informed of how much money their candidates 
raise and where that money comes from.

Do you know how the amount of funds your candidates running for house or 
senate races have raised and spent? And how they compare to other candidates 
from other districts or states? In this assignment we scrape and analyze data 
that will help us answer these questions.

First, we will get data on candidates in North Carolina. Then, you will 
use a similar approach to get data on candidates in a different state of your choosing.

In order to complete this assignment you will need a Chrome browser with the 
[Selector Gadget extension](http://selectorgadget.com/) installed.

```{marginfigure}
By now you should be familiar with instructions for getting started and setting 
up your git configuration. If not, you can refer to one of the earlier assignments.
```

# Packages

In this assignment we will work with the `tidyverse`, `rvest`, `robotstxt`, 
and `lubridate` packages. These packages should already be installed in your 
project, and you can load them with the following:

```{r load-packages, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(robotstxt)
library(lubridate)
```

# The data

```{r opensecrets, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.margin = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/opensecrets.png")
```

We will scrape and work with data on campain funds. The data come from 
[OpenSecrets.org](https://www.opensecrets.org), a "website tracking the influence 
of money on U.S. politics, and how that money affects policy and citizens' lives". 
This website hosted by The Center for Responsive Politics, which is a nonpartisan, 
independent nonprofit that "tracks money in U.S. politics and its effect on 
elections and public policy."[^1]

Before getting started, let's check that a bot has permissions to access pages 
on this domain.

```{r paths-allowed, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
paths_allowed("https://www.opensecrets.org")
```

## North Carolina races

```{r nc_races, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.margin = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/nc_races.png")
```

The goal of this exercise is scrape the data from a page that looks like the 
the page shown on the right, and save it as a data frame that looks like the 
data frame shown below.

```{r read-nc-page, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
nc_races <- read_csv("data/nc_races.csv")
datatable(nc_races, width="60%")
```

<br>

1. Based on the information on the [North Carolina congressional races page](https://www.opensecrets.org/races/election?id=NC), how many congressional 
races are there in NC?

The code for the following should go in the `scrape-nc.R` file.

- `race`: Let's start with the names of the races. Use the selector gadget to 
determine the path to the names of races, and create a character vector called 
`race`, containing the names of the races from the first column of the table 
shown in the screenshot above.

- `race_link`: Next, grab the URLs of the races, and save them as a character 
vector called `race_link`. Note that you need the full URL (as shown in the table 
above), not just the relative link.

- Then, create a data frame (a `tibble`) called `nc_races` with the variables 
`race` and `race_link`.

There are no senate elections in 2018 in North Carolina, but some of the other 
states will have senate elections. In order for your code to accurately capture 
data from other states as well, we'll add an indicator for the type of race: 
`House` or `Senate`.

- Mutate `nc_races` to add a new variable, `race_type`, that detects if the 
word `Senate` appears in the value of the `race` variable for a given race. If 
yes, value of `race_type` is set to `"Senate"`, and if no, it's set to `"House"`.
Two functions will help you with this task -- `ifelse()` and `str_detect()`:

```{r str-detect}
race_type = ifelse(str_detect(race, "Senate"), "Senate", "House")
```

- Save this data frame as `nc_races.csv` into the `/data` folder using the 
`write_csv` function : 

```{r write-csv}
write_csv(nc_races, path = "data/nc_races.csv")
```

2. Load `nc_races.csv` in your R Markdown file and save it as `nc_races`.

3. How many rows and how many variables does `nc_races` have? Does this match up 
with your expectation?

## North Carolina candidates

### Scrape candidates from District 1

Next we scrape data on candidates in the first district of North Carolina.

The code for the following should go in the `scrape-nc.R` file.

```{marginfigure}
Hint: The URL for this page is already saved in `nc_races$race_link[1]`.
```

- `race_page`: Read the page for the first district and save the result as `race_page`.

- `candidate_info`: Scrape the candidate info and save as a character vector 
called `candidate_info`. It will look something like the following.

  ```
  "G K Butterfield (D)\n • Incumbent" "Roger Allison (R)" 
  ```

```{marginfigure}
Hint: You'll need to deal with the dollar signs (`$`) and commas (`,`) in the values.
```

- `raised`, `spent`, `cash_on_hand`: Scrape the raised, spent, and cash on hand 
funds amounts and save them as numeric values.

- `last_report`: Scrape the date of `last_report`. This variable should have a 
`Date` class, formatted as `"yyyy-mm-dd"`, e.g. `"2018-06-30"`. You can use the
`mdy()` function from the `lubridate` package. This function takes in a 
character vector that is a date, and turns it into a vector with proper `Date` class.
```{r mdy, eval=TRUE}
mdy("06/30/2018")
```

- `race`: Scrape the name of the race from the header of the page. Note that 
this text will say `"North Carolina District 01 2018 Race"`. Remove `" 2018 Race"` 
from the character string so that it reads `""North Carolina District 01"`.

- `candidates`: Combine this information in a data frame called `candidates` with 
the variables `candidate_info`, `raised`, `spent`, `cash_on_hand`, `last_report`, 
and `race`.

Lastly, we need to clean up the information in the `candidate_info` data frame

```{marginfigure}
Hint: You'll need to escape the parantheses with backslashes.
```

- Create a new variable called `party` which has the following properties:
  - If `candidate_info` contains the character string `(R)`, label `Republican`
  - If `candidate_info` contains the character string `(D)`, label `Democrat`
  - Otherwise label `Third party`

- Create a new variable called `status` which has the value `Incumbent` if 
`candidate_info` contains the character string `Incumbent`, otherwise label 
`Challenger`

- Create a new variable called `candidate_name` which has only the candidate 
name from the `candidate_info` variable. This means deleting everything 
starting with the first open paranthesis (`(`) and trimming the character 
string. This is going to require getting fancy with **reg**ular **ex**pressions.
To match line breaks, indicated with `\n`, use `"\\n"`. And to match 
everything starting with the first `(`, use `"\\((.*)"`. For example, 

```{marginfigure}
At this point take a break to this [short but detailed article on regular expressions](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/articles/regular-expressions.html). 
Learning a bit more on regular experessions will give you a lot of facilty for 
working with text data.
```
    
```{r regex, eval=TRUE}
candidate_info <- "  G K Butterfield (D)\n • Incumbent\n    "

# remove all line breaks
candidate_info %>%
  str_remove_all("\\n")

# remove all line breaks + remove everything starting with (
candidate_info %>%
  str_remove_all("\\n") %>%
  str_remove("\\((.*)")

# remove all line breaks + remove everything starting with ( + trim white spaces
candidate_info %>%
  str_remove_all("\\n") %>%
  str_remove("\\((.*)") %>%
  str_trim()
```

```{marginfigure}
Hint: `select(race, everything())` would reorder the columns to move `race` up to 
be the first variable, and all the other variables would remain in the same 
order as before.
```
    
- Finally reorganize the data frame so that it only contains the variables 
`candidate_name`, `race`, `raised`, `spent`, `cash_on_hand`, `last_report`,
`party`, and `status`, in this order. Note that `candidate_info` is dropped. 
You will need to use the `select()` function to reorder the columns. As a 
requirement for this exercise, you should also use the `everything()` function, 
which will allow you to not have to type out all the variable names. See the 
help for this function to find out more about its usage.
  
- Save the resulting `candidates` data frame as `nc_candidates_dist01.csv` 
in your `data` folder.

4. Load `nc_candidates_dist01.csv` in your R Markdown document, save it as 
`nc_candidates_dist01`, and print it. Confirm that the data you have matches 
the one on the webpage.

At this point make sure you've committed and pushed your work so far.

### Scrape candidates from District 2

In your `scrape-nc.R` file, copy and paste the code you developed in the previous 
section for scraping District 1 data to the appropriate section for District 2. 
Change the input URL to the link for the second district, `nc_races$race_link[2]`.

The goal is to scrape the data for District 2 just like you scraped the data 
for District 1 in the previous section. You might find that you need to make some 
adjustments to your code. This is ok, go ahead and make them. But make sure to 
implement the same changes in your code for scraping District 1 candidates as 
well. You should get to a point where the same exact code works for both districts.

Write out the resulting data frame as `nc_candidates_dist02.csv` in your `data/`
folder.

5. Load `nc_candidates_dist02.csv` in your R Markdown document, save it as 
`nc_candidates_dist02`, and print it. Confirm that the data you have matches 
the one on the webpage.

Once again, make sure you've committed and pushed your work so far.

```{r functionalize, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.margin = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/functionalize.png")
```

### Writing a function

Now that you have confirmed your code works on two different pages, we'll work 
on turning your code into a function.

In the R script titled `scrape-race.R` create a function called `scrape_race` 
that has one input, `url`, and that outputs a tibble with number of rows 
corresponding to the number of candidates running for each race and six variables.

6. Source this function in your R Markdown file with the `source()` function as 
shown below. This will make the function available for use in the rest of your 
R Markdown document.

```{r source-fn}
source("scrape-race.R)
```

7. Apply this function to the URL for the North Carolina's first district race,
as shown below, and display the result. Confirm that your result matches your 
answer in Exercise 4.

```{r scrape-nc-dist1}
scrape_race(nc_races$race_link[1])
```

8. Now apply this function to the URL for the North Carolina's first district 
race, as shown below, and display the result. Confirm that your result matche 
your answer in Exercise 5.

```{r scrape-nc-dist2}
scrape_race(nc_races$race_link[2])
```

### Mapping the function

9. Now that you have confirmed that your function works for the first two 
districts when applied one-by-one, map it over the links for these two NC 
races and confirm that the result you get is a combination of the results from
Exercises 7 and 8.

```{r map-first-two}
map_df(nc_races$race_link[1:2], scrape_race)
```

10. And now that you have confirmed that mapping works for the first two 
districts, map the function over the links for *all* NC races and save the 
result as `nc_candidates` as shown below. Then, `glimpse()` at the resulting 
data frame.

```{r map-all}
nc_candidates <- map_df(nc_races$race_link, scrape_race)
```

If you're happy with your answer for Exercise 10, I recommend caching the results 
of the code chunk so that your code for scraping data from all NC races does not 
have to rerun every time you knit your document. To do this you need to is to add 
the following option to your code chunk: `cache = TRUE`, e.g. if the label you 
used for your code chunk is `map-all`, your code chunk definition will look like this:

```
{r map-all, cache = TRUE}
```

Then, knit your document one more time. Your code will run again, but this time 
a new folder will be created in your project where cached results will be saved. 
As with everything that changes in your repo, you will need to commit and push 
this folder as well. Going forward your code will only rerun if the code in the 
cached code chunk changes.

```{marginfigure}
Remember that you can use `everything()` for "all the other columns".
```

11. Join the `nc_candidates` and `nc_races` data frames by the `race` variable 
using an `inner_join()`. Then, reorganize the columns of of the resulting data 
frame to be in the following order: `candidate_name`, `race_type`, `race`, all 
the other columns. Save the result as `nc_candidates`, and `glimpse()` at the 
resulting data frame.

12. Answer the following questions based on the `nc_candidates` data frame 
you created in Exercise 11:  
**a.** What is the median amount of funds raised by all candidates in NC?  
**b.** What are the median amounts of funds raised by Republican, Democratic, 
and third party candidates in NC?  
**c.** Calculate the percentage of `cash_on_hand` compared to `raised` for all 
candidates in NC. Save the result as a new variable in the data frame 
called `perc_cash_on_hand`.  
**d.** Among all NC candidates, which candidate has the highest percentage of 
cash on hand?  
**e.** On average, have incumbents or challengers raised more money? Does this 
vary by party affiliation?
  
## Choose your own state

```{marginfigure}
You can copy and rename a file in RStudio using the menu items in the File pane 
with the same names. Check the box next to the file you want to copy, then go 
to More -> Copy. Then, check the box next to the newly created file to rename it 
using the Rename menu.
```

Make a copy of the `scrape-nc.R` file, and rename it to match a state of your 
own choosing, e.g. name it `scrape-ca.R` if you chose California.

13. Repeat what you did in the previous section (potentially with some 
modifications as needed) to  
**-** Scrape the data on all races in the state of your choice, create a data frame 
with variables `race`, `race_link`, and `race_type`, and save the data frame as 
a csv file in your `data/` folder.  
**-** Load this data file in your R Markdown document and, using the `scrape_races` 
function you developed earlier, scrape information on the candidates running in 
each of the races in your state. Save the result as a data frame.  
**-** Join the two data frames you have for this state by the `race` variable, and 
`glimpse()` at this data frame.  
**-** Use caching as outlined in the previous section to avoid rerunning of code 
that scrapes data.

14. Answer the following questions based on the data frame you loaded in Exercise 13:  
**a.** What is the median amount of funds raised by all candidates in your state?  
**b.** What are the median amounts of funds raised by Republican, Democratic, and
third party candidates in your state?  
**c.** Calculate the percentage of `cash_on_hand` compared to `raised` for all 
candidates in your state. Save the result as a new variable in the data frame 
called `perc_cash_on_hand`.  
**d.** Among all candidates in your state, which candidate has the highest 
percentage of cash on hand?  
**e.** On average, have incumbents or challengers raised more money? Does this 
vary by party affiliation? How do your findings compare to your earlier findings 
about NC?

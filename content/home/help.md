Most of you will need help at some point and we want to make sure you can identify when that is without getting too frustrated and feel comfortable seeking help.

- **Piazza:** The quickest way to get any questions on course content, technology, logistics, policies is to post your question on Piazza (and you are encouraged to answer each others' questions here as well). When you post a question on Piazza, you can choose to do so anonymously to your classmates. Note that the course instructors and tutors can always see your name, and this is for a good reason! We want to be able to identify students who might be struggling so that we can extend help. Similarly, we want to know who you are if you're providing great answers to others' questions! Sign up for Piazza [here](https://piazza.com/ed.ac.uk/fall2019/math08077), with the access code you received in your email / posted on Learn.
- **Mathsbase:** You can also ask questions in person at [Mathsbase](https://teaching.maths.ed.ac.uk/main/undergraduate/studies/facilities/mathsbase-mathshub). When we know the schedule for when members of the course teaching team will be at Mathsbase, we will post them here. Note that staffing will start in Week 2.
- **Student hours:** I will hold student hours on Tuesdays, 14:30 - 16:00 at my office. Please feel free to stop by with any questions, or just to say hi! I am also available to meet by appointment, please use the link below to request one.
- **Email:** Please refrain from emailing any course content questions (those should go on Piazza), and only use email for questions about personal matters that may not be appropriate for the public course forum (e.g. illness, concessions).
- For more general support and advice, please make use of the following resources:
  - Your personal tutor (especially if you are struggling in general)
  - Student learning advisor for the course
  - [Institue for Academic Development](https://www.ed.ac.uk/institute-academic-development) (for more generic study skills information)
  - [The Advice Place](https://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/support_and_advice/the_advice_place/)
  - [Student Disability Service](https://www.ed.ac.uk/student-disability-service).

Make good use of this support system, it is there for you! And if you're not sure where to go for help, just ask any academic or administrative member of the course team.
